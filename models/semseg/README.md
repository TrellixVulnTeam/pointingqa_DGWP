Description of model

We get similar performance using ResNet101 and ResNet32. To replicate the ResNet101 results, run the file go.run_semseg.sh. This uses a ResNet101 model pretrained on ImageNet. To see training progress, we recommend using tensorboardX, though you can also observe the resulting log file in the specified artifact directory.
